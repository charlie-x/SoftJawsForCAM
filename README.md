# SoftJawsForCAM

Conversion of the JavaScript Soft Jaws Plugin to a C++ plugin for Fusion360

The JavaScript version was created by Matthew Nichols, it is their project.

this is just a conversion to C++ since Fusion360 no longer supports JavaScript.

The docs are still correct. After running  it it'll add itself to the Mesh/Create menu

clone or extract this folder to 

C:\Users\\%USERNAME%\AppData\Roaming\Autodesk\Autodesk Fusion 360\API\AddIns

so it'd be 

SoftJamsCAM\SoftJawsCAM.dll etc

The run it from the Add plugin menu.
